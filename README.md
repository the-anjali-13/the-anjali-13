👋 Hi  Viewers, I’m Anjali Sharma, a computer science student passionate about web development, backend development, and creating unique projects. Currently pursuing my third year in computer science engineering, I'm also a fellow at CCBP 4.0 Academy | Nxt Wave. I have a strong foundation in Java, MySQL, JDBC, Servlets, frontend development (HTML & CSS), and more, eager to showcase my projects using these technologies and beyond on this platform.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to enhance my skills, especially interested in open-source contributions, team projects, and collaborative opportunities. If I can contribute by my skills, I'll be grateful to join such initiatives.

🌱 I hold a certificate in Java, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and professional development. As a beginner, I seek support and guidance to improve with each project I create. I'm also eager to learn ReactJS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB to broaden my skill set.

📫 You can reach me through my LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/anjali-sharma-902770226) and email.

⚡ Fun fact: Besides coding, my hobbies include drawing and sketching. I also excel in public speaking, having hosted events in my college and receiving recognition for my team's performance.
